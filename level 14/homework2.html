        <b style="background-color: aliceblue;">The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus)
            is a bear species in the family Ursidae found in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.
            It is the only species in the genus Helarctos and the smallest bear species, standing nearly 70 cm (28 in)
            at the shoulder and weighing 25–65 kg (55–143 lb). It is stockily built, with large paws, strongly curved claws,
            small, rounded ears and a short snout. The fur is generally short and jet black, but can vary from grey to red.
            The sun bear gets its name from its characteristic orange to cream-coloured chest patch. Its unique morphology—inward-turned front feet,
            flattened chest, powerful forelimbs with large claws—suggests adaptations for climbing.

            <b style="background-color: aliceblue;">bear fact:The American black bear is not closely related to the brown bear or polar bear,
                 though all three species are found in North America;
                 genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 million years ago.</b>

        <b style="background-color: aliceblue;">The American black bear (Ursus americanus), or simply black bear,
             is a species of medium-sized bear which is endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species.
              It is an omnivore, with a diet varying greatly depending on season and location. It typically lives in largely forested areas;
             it will leave forests in search of food and is sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food.
