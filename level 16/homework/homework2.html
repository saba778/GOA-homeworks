<p><b style="background-color: whitesmoke;border: 1px lightblue ridge;">The seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series range consists of
     the BMW G20 (sedan version) and BMW G21 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring') compact executive cars.
      The G20/G21 has been in production since mid-October 2018 with a facelift in July 2022 and 
      is often collectively referred to as the G20.</b></p>

<p><b style="background-color: whitesmoke;border: 1px lightblue ridge;">The M340i, one
     of the first models in the range, became available for sale in the spring of 2019, with
      the 330e plug-in hybrid model scheduled for launch in 2020. The 3 Series Gran Turismo
     fastback body style was discontinued for the G20 generation.</b></p>

<p><b style= "background-color: whitesmoke;border: 1px lightblue ridge;">At the end of November 2015
    , a final design proposal for the successor of the F30 3 Series by Alexey Kezha out of 3 total, was
     chosen by BMW management, as reported by Auto Bild in October 2015. The new 3 Series, internally called
      the G20, was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on October 2, 2018, and was available for sale in March 2019
      . In 2023, tests by the Graz University of Technology found that the plug-in
       hybrid version of the car (along with several other pug-in hybrids) emits more than three times as much carbon dioxide
        per kilometre as the results from the manadated government laboratory test procedures indicate, with 112 grammes released
         per kilometre travelled in the universities on-road test
     as opposed to the official claim of 36 grammes released per kilometres travelled.</b></p>
